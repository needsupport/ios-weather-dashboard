# iOS Weather Dashboard

A comprehensive native iOS weather application built with SwiftUI that provides detailed weather forecasts, historical data comparison, and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- Current weather conditions with detailed metrics
- 7-day forecast with daily temperature ranges and conditions
- Hourly forecast with detailed breakdowns
- Weather data visualization with historical comparisons
- Interactive weather cards for each forecast day
- Location searching and current location detection

## Architecture

This project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Models**: Define data structures and business logic
- **ViewModels**: Manage state, business logic, and data transformation
- **Views**: SwiftUI components that present data to the user
- **Services**: Handle API communication and data persistence

## Implementation Details

### Code Design

The application follows a reactive programming paradigm using Combine:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - ViewModels expose `@Published` properties that the Views observe
   - Data changes trigger automatic UI updates through the observation system
   - Services return `AnyPublisher` types for asynchronous operations

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Services are injected into ViewModels via constructors
   - This allows for easier testing and swapping of implementations

3. **Protocol-Based Design**:
   - Services implement protocols (e.g., `WeatherServiceProtocol`)
   - Enables multiple implementations (production, mock) sharing common interfaces

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error system with dedicated error types and handling logic
   - Errors are propagated up and displayed in user-friendly formats
   - Fallback to cached data when network requests fail

5. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Tiered caching with different expiration times for different data types
   - Hourly data expires faster than daily forecast data
   - Expired cache data is still available as fallback during network errors

### Current Status

#### Completed
- Core MVVM architecture setup
- Model definitions for weather data
- Main view implementations (current weather, cards, chart, location)
- Weather service with API integrations
- Location services integration with saved locations
- Mock data service for development
- Basic unit tests for ViewModel
- User preferences system
- Robust caching system with fallback mechanisms
- Location management with multiple saved locations
- Widget extension implementation

#### In Progress
- CoreData migration for improved data storage
- Enhanced location handling for non-US locations
- Comprehensive testing implementation
- UI animations and transitions for smoother experience
- Performance optimization for larger datasets
- Accessibility improvements

#### To Do
- Dynamic Island integration (iOS 16+)
- Dark mode optimizations
- User preference persistence across app launches
- Advanced charts for historical data
- Push notification handling for severe weather alerts
- Background refresh implementation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Priority: High)

1. **CoreData Migration** ([Issue #11](https://github.com/needsupport/ios-weather-dashboard/issues/11))
   - Migrate from UserDefaults to CoreData for better data management
   - Create proper entities for weather data, forecasts, and locations
   - Implement data migration path
   - Add background sync capabilities

## Development Timeline

- **Short-term (1-2 months)**: Complete CoreData migration, location handling, and testing
- **Medium-term (3-4 months)**: Implement UI improvements and widget optimization
- **Long-term (5-6 months)**: Add advanced features and platform integrations

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 15.0+ (iOS 16.0+ recommended for all features)
- Swift 5.7+
- An API key from OpenWeather (for live data)

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ios-weather-dashboard.git
cd ios-weather-dashboard
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open WeatherApp.xcodeproj
```

3. Configure API keys:
   - Navigate to `WeatherApp/Services/WeatherAPIService.swift`
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenWeather API key

4. Build and run the application on your device or simulator

### Using Mock Data

For development without an API key:
1. Navigate to `WeatherApp/ViewModels/WeatherViewModel.swift`
2. In the `init()` method, replace `self.weatherService = WeatherService()` with `self.weatherService = MockWeatherService()`

## Testing

Run the included unit tests to verify:
- Data fetching and error handling
- Temperature unit conversion
- Icon mapping
- Location handling
- Cache expiration behavior

## Performance Optimizations

The app implements several performance optimizations:
- Lazy loading of view components
- Data caching for API responses with tiered expiration
- Conditional rendering to reduce view complexity
- Efficient redrawing of chart components
- Background task management for optimal battery usage

## Core Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented via SwiftUI's `@Published` and `@ObservedObject`
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into ViewModels
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating different service implementations
- **Adapter Pattern**: Used for adapting different API responses to our model
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented in the data layer for abstracting data sources
- **Extension Pattern**: Used to segregate ViewModel functionality into focused extensions

## Known Issues

- Chart visualization might not render correctly on smaller devices when many data points are shown
- Weather alerts sometimes display brief loading delay on initial fetch
- Location selection occasionally requires multiple attempts on first launch
- Temperature conversion doesn't update immediately in some edge cases

## Engineering Notes

### Architecture Assessment
- The MVVM architecture has significantly improved testability and separation of concerns
- ViewModel extensions provide a clean way to separate functionality domains
- Protocol-based service layer is working well for testability and mock data

### Code Quality
- Consider implementing SwiftLint for consistent code style
- Weather data model could benefit from more documentation
- Some view components (especially charts) have grown complex and may need refactoring
- Cache implementation works well but should be migrated to CoreData for larger datasets

### Critical Paths
- Error handling for network failures is now robust with cached data fallbacks
- Location services have multiple fallback mechanisms for reliable operation
- Widget extension shares code with main app to reduce duplication

### Future Technical Debt Concerns
- The current UserDefaults-based cache won't scale well with increased data volume
- Some SwiftUI views exceed 300 lines and should be refactored into smaller components
- Chart rendering code has performance issues on older devices with large datasets
- Weather API response mapping has some duplication that should be abstracted
