# iOS Weather Dashboard

A comprehensive native iOS weather application built with SwiftUI that provides detailed weather forecasts, historical data comparison, and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- Current weather conditions with detailed metrics
- 7-day forecast with daily temperature ranges and conditions
- Hourly forecast with detailed breakdowns
- Weather data visualization with historical comparisons
- Interactive weather cards for each forecast day
- Location searching and current location detection
- Custom location input support
- Detailed day view with extended information
- Weather alerts display
- Unit conversion (°C/°F)
- Responsive layout for all iOS devices
- Support for both OpenWeather API and National Weather Service

## Architecture

This project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Models**: Define data structures and business logic
- **ViewModels**: Manage state, business logic, and data transformation
- **Views**: SwiftUI components that present data to the user
- **Services**: Handle API communication and data persistence

## Implementation Details

### Code Design

The application follows a reactive programming paradigm using Combine:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - ViewModels expose `@Published` properties that the Views observe
   - Data changes trigger automatic UI updates through the observation system
   - Services return `AnyPublisher` types for asynchronous operations

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Services are injected into ViewModels via constructors
   - This allows for easier testing and swapping of implementations

3. **Protocol-Based Design**:
   - Services implement protocols (e.g., `WeatherServiceProtocol`)
   - Enables multiple implementations (production, mock) sharing common interfaces

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error system with dedicated error types and handling logic
   - Errors are propagated up and displayed in user-friendly formats

### Current Status

#### Completed
- Core MVVM architecture setup
- Model definitions for weather data
- Main view implementations (current weather, cards, chart, location)
- Weather service with API integrations
- Location services integration
- Mock data service for development
- Basic unit tests for ViewModel
- Basic user preferences system

#### In Progress
- Comprehensive error handling
- Offline mode with data caching
- Completing UI animations and transitions
- Widget integration for home and lock screens
- Expanding test coverage

#### To Do
- Dynamic Island integration (iOS 16+)
- Dark mode optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
- User preference persistence
- Complete widget implementation
- Advanced charts for historical data
- Push notification handling for alerts

## Roadmap

### Near-term (1-3 months)
- Complete offline mode with persistent storage
- Add detailed historical data comparisons
- Implement weather alert notifications
- Complete widget system for all supported sizes
- Enhance data visualization with more chart types

### Mid-term (3-6 months)
- Add precipitation radar maps
- Integrate air quality data
- Add pollen and allergen forecasts
- Support for multiple saved locations
- Theme customization options
- Apple Watch companion app

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Weather camera integration from public sources
- Trip planning feature with weather forecasts
- Weather impact assessment for scheduled events
- Integration with smart home platforms (HomeKit)
- Machine learning for personalized forecasts

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 15.0+ (iOS 16.0+ recommended for all features)
- Swift 5.7+
- An API key from OpenWeather (for live data)

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ios-weather-dashboard.git
cd ios-weather-dashboard
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open WeatherApp.xcodeproj
```

3. Configure API keys:
   - Navigate to `WeatherApp/Services/WeatherAPIService.swift`
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenWeather API key

4. Build and run the application on your device or simulator

### Using Mock Data

For development without an API key:
1. Navigate to `WeatherApp/ViewModels/WeatherViewModel.swift`
2. In the `init()` method, replace `self.weatherService = WeatherService()` with `self.weatherService = MockWeatherService()`

## Testing

Run the included unit tests to verify:
- Data fetching and error handling
- Temperature unit conversion
- Icon mapping
- Location handling

## Performance Optimizations

The app implements several performance optimizations:
- Lazy loading of view components
- Data caching for API responses
- Conditional rendering to reduce view complexity
- Efficient redrawing of chart components

## Core Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented via SwiftUI's `@Published` and `@ObservedObject`
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into ViewModels
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating different service implementations
- **Adapter Pattern**: Used for adapting different API responses to our model
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented in the data layer for abstracting data sources

## Known Issues

- Chart visualization might not render correctly on smaller devices when many data points are shown
- Weather alerts sometimes display brief loading delay on initial fetch
- Location selection occasionally requires multiple attempts on first launch
- Temperature conversion doesn't update immediately in some edge cases
