## Architecture

This project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Models**: Define data structures and business logic
- **ViewModels**: Manage state, business logic, and data transformation
- **Views**: SwiftUI components that present data to the user
- **Services**: Handle API communication and data persistence

## Implementation Details

### Code Design

The application follows a reactive programming paradigm using Combine:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - ViewModels expose `@Published` properties that the Views observe
   - Data changes trigger automatic UI updates through the observation system
   - Services return `AnyPublisher` types for asynchronous operations

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Services are injected into ViewModels via constructors
   - This allows for easier testing and swapping of implementations

3. **Protocol-Based Design**:
   - Services implement protocols (e.g., `WeatherServiceProtocol`)
   - Enables multiple implementations (production, mock) sharing common interfaces

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error system with dedicated error types and handling logic
   - Errors are propagated up and displayed in user-friendly formats
   - Fallback to cached data when network requests fail

5. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Tiered caching with different expiration times for different data types
   - Hourly data expires faster than daily forecast data
   - Expired cache data is still available as fallback during network errors

### Current Status

#### Completed
- Core MVVM architecture setup
- Model definitions for weather data
- Main view implementations (current weather, cards, chart, location)
- Weather service with API integrations
- Location services integration with saved locations
- Mock data service for development
- Basic unit tests for ViewModel
- User preferences system
- Robust caching system with fallback mechanisms
- Location management with multiple saved locations
- Widget extension implementation

#### In Progress
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messaging
- UI animations and transitions for smoother experience
- Expanding test coverage
- Performance optimization for larger datasets
- Accessibility improvements

#### To Do
- Dynamic Island integration (iOS 16+)
- Dark mode optimizations
- User preference persistence across app launches
- Advanced charts for historical data
- Push notification handling for severe weather alerts
- Background refresh implementation

## Roadmap

### Near-term (1-3 months)
- Complete offline mode with persistent storage (CoreData migration)
- Add detailed historical data comparisons
- Implement weather alert notifications
- Enhance data visualization with more chart types
- Add pull-to-refresh for weather data

### Mid-term (3-6 months)
- Add precipitation radar maps
- Integrate air quality data
- Add pollen and allergen forecasts
- Theme customization options
- Apple Watch companion app

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Weather camera integration from public sources
- Trip planning feature with weather forecasts
- Weather impact assessment for scheduled events
- Integration with smart home platforms (HomeKit)
- Machine learning for personalized forecasts

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 15.0+ (iOS 16.0+ recommended for all features)
- Swift 5.7+
- An API key from OpenWeather (for live data)

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ios-weather-dashboard.git
cd ios-weather-dashboard
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open WeatherApp.xcodeproj
```

3. Configure API keys:
   - Navigate to `WeatherApp/Services/WeatherAPIService.swift`
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenWeather API key

4. Build and run the application on your device or simulator

### Using Mock Data

For development without an API key:
1. Navigate to `WeatherApp/ViewModels/WeatherViewModel.swift`
2. In the `init()` method, replace `self.weatherService = WeatherService()` with `self.weatherService = MockWeatherService()`

## Testing

Run the included unit tests to verify:
- Data fetching and error handling
- Temperature unit conversion
- Icon mapping
- Location handling
- Cache expiration behavior

## Performance Optimizations

The app implements several performance optimizations:
- Lazy loading of view components
- Data caching for API responses with tiered expiration
- Conditional rendering to reduce view complexity
- Efficient redrawing of chart components
- Background task management for optimal battery usage

## Core Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented via SwiftUI's `@Published` and `@ObservedObject`
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into ViewModels
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating different service implementations
- **Adapter Pattern**: Used for adapting different API responses to our model
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented in the data layer for abstracting data sources
- **Extension Pattern**: Used to segregate ViewModel functionality into focused extensions

## Known Issues

- Chart visualization might not render correctly on smaller devices when many data points are shown
- Weather alerts sometimes display brief loading delay on initial fetch
- Location selection occasionally requires multiple attempts on first launch
- Temperature conversion doesn't update immediately in some edge cases

## Engineering Notes

### Architecture Assessment
- The MVVM architecture has significantly improved testability and separation of concerns
- ViewModel extensions provide a clean way to separate functionality domains
- Protocol-based service layer is working well for testability and mock data

### Code Quality
- Consider implementing SwiftLint for consistent code style
- Weather data model could benefit from more documentation
- Some view components (especially charts) have grown complex and may need refactoring
- Cache implementation works well but should be migrated to CoreData for larger datasets

### Critical Paths
- Error handling for network failures is now robust with cached data fallbacks
- Location services have multiple fallback mechanisms for reliable operation
- Widget extension shares code with main app to reduce duplication

### Testing Considerations
- Current test coverage is approximately 65% 
- Need more UI tests for critical user flows
- Cache expiration logic should have dedicated tests
- Consider implementing snapshot tests for UI components

### Future Technical Debt Concerns
- The current UserDefaults-based cache won't scale well with increased data volume
- Some SwiftUI views exceed 300 lines and should be refactored into smaller components
- Chart rendering code has performance issues on older devices with large datasets
- Weather API response mapping has some duplication that should be abstracted

### Recommendations for Next Sprint
1. Prioritize CoreData migration for the caching system
2. Implement UI tests for critical user flows
3. Improve error messaging for better user experience
4. Optimize chart rendering for performance on older devices
5. Implement background refresh capability for up-to-date widgets
